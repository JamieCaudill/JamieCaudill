🌱 I’m currently learning Front End Development at Turing School of Software and Design. 

🏔 I am a former ski/rock climbing instructor and professional photographer with a BA in Sustainability studies who is excited about this new path and ready to learn.

💬 My favorite ways to spend my freetime include: skiing, climbing, surfing, photography, writing and performing music, and drinking tea while reading books.
